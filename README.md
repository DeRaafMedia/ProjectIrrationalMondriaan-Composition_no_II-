ProjectIrrationalMondriaan
==========================

This project was writen more than 6 years ago as an exploration of what I could do with the Processing.org enviroment.

Since I upgraded to Yosemite a lot of old Processing sketches broke, rather than fixing the problem I wanted to do a complete rewrite (JAVA is dead?).

===========================

(This specific painitng is sound reactive (viewer needs to yell really hard for the full effect). The solid red dot in the middle will grow in size with higher volume screams. [Example with music -->](http://youtu.be/p7RZk_H7OGk)).

Written and only tested with Mac OS X Yosemite, Xcode 6.1 and I used a Nightly Build openFrameworks (wanted to test some new upcoming functionality)

A short description on how to install this software can be found in this projects [wiki](https://github.com/DeRaafMedia/ProjectIrrationalMondriaan-Composition_no_II-/wiki)
